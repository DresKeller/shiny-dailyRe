<h4>Assessment of the current epidemiological situation</h4>

The effective reproduction number R<sub>e</sub> has fallen below the critical value of 1 in mid March. All estimates of R<sub>e</sub> are now based only on data from the FOPH, since the openZH data have recently been updated with decreasing frequency. R<sub>e</sub> has increased slowly since mid April. The uncertainty intervals have increased due to the small case numbers and currently contain the critical value of 1.

<h4>Methods</h4>

When the sliding window option is selected, the R<sub>e</sub> for a particular day is the average R<sub>e</sub> over the three most recent days. Instead, the stepwise constant option assumes the R<sub>e</sub> to be constant between changes in public health interventions. We show the estimated median R<sub>e</sub> together with 95% uncertainty intervals.

The core calculations employ [EpiEstim](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/178/9/1505/89262). Further calculations and settings required to analyze the available COVID-19 data are explained [here](https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20271). An extension of the method, which allows earlier detection of changes of R<sub>e</sub> is currently being developed and will likely be introduced in the near future.

Generally our assessment of the epidemiological situation is based on multiple methods, see [Appendix A in Policy Brief «Effect of Measures»](https://ncs-tf.ch/de/policy-briefs/effect-of-measures-21-april-20-en/download). The precise estimates are different, but the trends are consistent across methods.
