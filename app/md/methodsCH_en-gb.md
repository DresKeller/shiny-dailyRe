<h4>Assessment of current epidemiological situation</h4>

The effective reproductive number R<sub>e</sub> in early March was 2-3.5, which is in the range of reproductive numbers reported for other places. The R<sub>e</sub> fell below the critical value of 1 in mid March. R<sub>e </sub>has increased continuously since the second week of May towards a peak in mid-June, with values around 1.4-1.9. Currently, R<sub>e</sub> is again lower and the uncertainty interval includes 1.

The number of weekly tests increased throughout June. Incorporating this increase confirms that R<sub>e</sub> was significantly above 1 in mid-June. This result reflects the observed increase in test positivity. The specificity of PCR tests is very high, leading to essentially no false positive results which could bias our estimates. In addition to an increase in the number of confirmed cases, we also observed an increase in the number of hospitalizations in June. In summary, all considered data and analyses point towards an exponential spread of COVID-19 in June. Currently, the situation is slightly less concerning. We note though that in general recent estimates may vary a bit between individual days.
 
<h4>Methods</h4>

The reported R<sub>e</sub> for a given day is the mean R<sub>e</sub> over the last 3 days. We report the median with the 95% uncertainty interval. Details regarding the core method can be found [here](https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20271). We improved the method to infer infection dates from the observed data by using a [deconvolution](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/51/21825) step as discussed in two recent pre-prints [(1)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.20134858v2)[(2)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099366v1). The deconvolution step allows to detect changes in R<sub>e</sub> more rapidly. In particular, we now obtain an R<sub>e</sub> which is significantly above 1 since the second week of June. Further, our estimates at the start of the epidemic are higher than previously reported. Results based on data from June 26, 2020 using the original method can be accessed [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/covid-19-Re/covid19-additionalData/master/misc/2020-06-27_results_CH_convolution_method.png).

All estimates of R<sub>e</sub> are now based on data from the FOPH while we previously used data from openZH. The change was made because the openZH data have recently been updated with decreasing frequency.

Every day, the FOPH communicates the number of newly confirmed cases that they received over the last 24 hours. These cases typically stem from the last three days. To estimate R<sub>e</sub> we analyse the number of newly confirmed cases from each particular day. Thus the numbers in our dashboard are different from the numbers given in the daily FOPH situation reports. As it may take several days for a confirmed case to be reported through the FOPH, the most recent case numbers and thus the estimated R<sub>e</sub> may still increase a bit over the next few days.

Generally our assessment of the epidemiological situation is based on multiple methods, see [Appendix A in Policy Brief «Effect of Measures»](https://ncs-tf.ch/de/policy-briefs/effect-of-measures-21-april-20-en/download). The precise estimates are different, but the trends are consistent across methods.
