<h4>Assessment of the current epidemiological situation</h4>

The effective reproductive number R<sub>e</sub> quantifies the average number of infections caused by an infected individual. R<sub>e</sub> dropped below the critical threshold of 1 on March 22, and continues to be significantly below 1 based on information from the daily confirmed case counts. The uncertainty around the estimate based on the daily number of new hospitalizations and deaths is wider due to lower daily numbers. If case numbers decrease further, the uncertainty interval based on confirmed cases may also not exclude the critical value of 1 any more.

<h4>Methods</h4>

When the sliding window option is selected, the R<sub>e</sub> for a particular day is the average R<sub>e</sub> over the three most recent days. Instead, the stepwise constant option assumes the R<sub>e</sub> to be constant between changes in public health interventions. We show the estimated median R<sub>e</sub> together with 95% uncertainty intervals.
