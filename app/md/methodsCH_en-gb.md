<h4>Assessment of current epidemiological situation</h4>

The effective reproductive number R<sub>e</sub> in early March was 2-3, which is in the range of values reported for other countries. The R<sub>e</sub> fell below the critical value of 1 in mid March. R<sub>e</sub> has increased continuously since the second week of May towards a peak in mid-June, with maximum values around 1.4-1.9. Another smaller peak was observed in July. The peaks were driven by infection dynamics in separate geographic regions in Switzerland.
*In recent weeks, R<sub>e</sub> has reached a steady value around 1.1. This means that the case numbers currently double approximately every 4 weeks.*

In general, we note that the R<sub>e</sub> estimates for the most recent days may be subject to slight fluctuations. We thus base our interpretation on estimated trends over several days.

R<sub>e</sub> values above 1 since June are not a consequence of an increased testing effort or of false positive test results. The number of weekly tests did indeed increase throughout the summer. Simultaneously however, the percentage of positive tests among all tests (i.e. the test positivity rate) has increased from 0.4% in June to around 3% at the moment. When correcting for the increase in testing effort in the statistical analyses, we still estimate R<sub>e</sub> significantly above 1 for most of the summer. Additionally, the specificity of PCR tests is very high, leading to essentially no false positive results which could bias our estimates.
We provide additional tools for the assessment of the epidemiological situation here. In particular, we provide estimates of R<sub>e</sub> for individual cantons, larger Swiss regions, and other countries. These R<sub>e</sub>  estimates, as well as the case numbers per country, are displayed on a world map. Additionally, we show estimates on the changes of R<sub>e</sub> following the introduction or release of interventions. Lastly, we display the course of the estimated number of daily new infections based on the daily case data. This course is used for the R<sub>e</sub> calculations. The results for R<sub>e</sub> are available as a .csv file.



<h4>Methods</h4>

The reported R<sub>e</sub> for a given day is the mean R<sub>e</sub> over the last 3 days. We report the estimated median with the 95% uncertainty interval. The method to estimate R<sub>e</sub> is described [here](https://ibz-shiny.ethz.ch/covid-19-re/methods.pdf). Since June, we first smooth the data with a LOESS step, and then estimate the infection dates using a [deconvolution](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/51/21825) step (discussed [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099366v1) and [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.20134858v2)). Then, we estimate R<sub>e</sub>  using the [EpiEstim](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiEstim/index.html) software from the estimated infection dates. Results based on data from June 26, 2020 using the original method can be accessed [here](https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20271).

Since June 2020, all estimates of R<sub>e</sub> are based on data from the FOPH. Every day, the FOPH communicates the number of newly confirmed cases that they received over the last 24 hours. These cases typically stem from the last three days. To estimate R<sub>e</sub> we therefore analyse the number of newly confirmed cases from each particular day ignoring the past two days. As a result, the numbers in our dashboard are different from the numbers given in the daily FOPH situation reports.

Generally our assessment of the epidemiological situation is based on multiple methods, see [Appendix A in Policy Brief «Effect of Measures»](https://ncs-tf.ch/de/policy-briefs/effect-of-measures-21-april-20-en/download). The precise estimates are different, but the trends are consistent across methods.
