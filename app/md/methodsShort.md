#### Assessment of epidemiological situation
The effective reproductive number R<sub>e</sub> quantifies the average number of infections caused by an infected individual. R<sub>e</sub> dropped below the critical threshold of 1 on March 22, and continues to be significantly below 1 based on  daily confirmed cases and daily hospitalizations. The uncertainty around the estimate that is based on the daily number of deaths is wider. It is important to note that the estimates of R<sub>e</sub> based on daily confirmed cases after April 12 may be biased upward due to a change in the testing strategy after April 22 (confirmed cases after April 22 correspond to new infections after April 12 on average).

#### Methods

The R<sub>e</sub> for a particular day is the average R<sub>e</sub> over the three most recent days. We show estimated median Re together with 95% uncertainty intervals. The method for estimating Re is explained [here](https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20271).
