<h4>Methods</h4>

When the sliding window option is selected, the R<sub>e</sub> for a particular day is the average R<sub>e</sub> over the three most recent days. Instead, the stepwise constant option assumes the R<sub>e</sub> to be constant between changes in public health interventions. We show the estimated median R<sub>e</sub> together with 95% uncertainty intervals.
The core calculations employ [EpiEstim](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/178/9/1505/89262). Further calculations and settings required to analyze the available COVID-19 data are explained [here](https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20271).
