<h4>Methods</h4>

The reported R<sub>e</sub> for a given day is the mean R<sub>e</sub> over the last 3 days. We report the median with the 95% uncertainty interval. Details regarding the core method can be found [here](https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20271). We improved the method to infer infection dates from the observed data by using a [deconvolution](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/51/21825) step as discussed in two recent pre-prints [(1)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.20134858v2)[(2)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099366v1). The deconvolution step allows to detect changes in R<sub>e</sub> more rapidly. In particular, we now obtain an R<sub>e</sub> which is significantly above 1 since the second week of June. Further, our estimates at the start of the epidemic are higher than previously reported. Results based on data from June 26, 2020 using the original method can be accessed [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/covid-19-Re/covid19-additionalData/master/misc/2020-06-27_results_CH_convolution_method.png).
