<h4>Methods</h4>

The reported R<sub>e</sub> for a given day is the mean R<sub>e</sub> over the last 3 days. We report the median with the 95% uncertainty interval. Details regarding the core method can be found [here](https://ibz-shiny.ethz.ch/covid-19-re/methods.pdf). We improved the method to infer infection dates from the observed data by using a [deconvolution](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/51/21825) step as discussed in two recent pre-prints [(1)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.20134858v2)[(2)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099366v1). The deconvolution step allows to detect changes in R<sub>e</sub> more rapidly.

**Disclaimer**: The quality of the R<sub>e</sub> estimate for a particular country or region relies on the quality of the data set. We only check the quality of data for some countries, in particular Switzerland and some surrounding countries.  Before drawing conclusions for a particular country, check the data quality. In particular, spikes in reporting on particular days or missing data on many days can bias Re estimates.
