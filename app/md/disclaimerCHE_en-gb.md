- The effective reproductive number R<sub>e</sub> quantifies how many people are infected on average by an infected person. We provide the latest estimate of the effective reproductive number R<sub>e</sub> in Switzerland. This figure is updated daily with the latest available data from the FOPH. The R<sub>e</sub> estimates are available in csv format at https://github.com/covid-19-Re/dailyRe-Data.
- The R<sub>e</sub> value which is calculated today reflects the infection dynamics of about 10 days ago for Switzerland and 14 days for cantons, due to the delay between infection and positive test result. The most recent R<sub>e</sub> value is marked with an asterisk in the figure.
- **IMPORTANT**: In general, we note that the R<sub>e</sub> estimates for the last days may still be consolidated during subsequent days. This consolidation in particular occurs for small regions, during changes in the dynamics, and in case of small case numbers. For details on methods and caveats please see below.
- **IMPORTANT FOR HOLIDAY SEASON**: Please note that R<sub>e</sub> values based on confirmed cases over the holiday season may be underestimates due to possibly less testing during these days.
