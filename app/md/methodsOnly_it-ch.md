<h4>Metodi</h4>

The reported R<sub>e</sub> for a given day is the mean R<sub>e</sub> over the last 3 days. We report the median with the 95% uncertainty interval. Details regarding the core method can be found [here](https://ibz-shiny.ethz.ch/covid-19-re/methods.pdf). We improved the method to infer infection dates from the observed data by using a [deconvolution](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/51/21825) step as discussed in two recent pre-prints [(1)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.18.20134858v2)[(2)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.12.20099366v1). The deconvolution step allows to detect changes in R<sub>e</sub> more rapidly.
